# Bitcoin Futures Price Forecasting (in progress)

I am using Python to forecast the price of Bitcoin futures contracts traded on FTX (an online cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency derivatives exchange). I am using the scikit-learn library as well as the Support Vector Regression Machine Learning algorithm to forecast these prices. The dataset is comprised of price and trading volume data (collected at 15-minute intervals) for Bitcoin as well as Bitcoin futures contracts traded on FTX from September 2019 through to May 2022.

NOTE: the data were retrieved using a private API key, and so the notebook used to acquire the data has not been uploaded.
